# Curvature-Flow-With-Euler-Mathod

## Project Introduction
In this project, the **{Euler Method** and differentiation using **Fast Fourier Transform** and **Inverse Fast Fourier Transform**, to we de-noise a predefined initial 2D-curve surface and obtain a smooth curve as output.

Investigating the method, we verified that the time complexity is loglinear, which is O(Mlog(M)), and that the rate of convergence is first order, which is O(h).

At last, we observed that the method is not unconditionally stable. For larger values of M, one may need larger value of N correspondingly to ensure that the method converges.
