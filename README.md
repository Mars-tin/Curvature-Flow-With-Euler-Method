# Curvature-Flow-With-Euler-Mathod

## Project Introduction
In this project, the **Euler Method** and differentiation using **Fast Fourier Transform** and **Inverse Fast Fourier Transform**, to we de-noise a predefined initial 2D-curve surface and obtain a smooth curve as output.

See [report.pdf](https://github.com/Mars-tin/Curvature-Flow-With-Euler-Method/blob/master/report.pdf) for details.
